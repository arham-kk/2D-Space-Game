- Press escape to pause the game.

## Dependencies

This game requires Pygame to be installed. You can install Pygame using pip:
"pip install pygame"

## Running the Game

To run the game, simply run the 2D Game.py script:
"python 2D Game.py"

## Code Overview

The shooting_game.py script initializes Pygame, loads game assets, sets up the game window, and creates the game loop. In the game loop, it handles user input, updates the game state, renders game objects, and checks for collisions between projectiles and enemies. It also spawns new enemies at regular intervals and removes enemies and projectiles that go off the screen. The game loop can be paused by pressing the ESC key, and the game can be resumed by pressing the space bar. The game ends if an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen or if the player collides with an enemy.
